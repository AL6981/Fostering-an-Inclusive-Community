# Key Terms & Concepts  

*Having a shared vocabulary and common understanding of terms supports an active and productive dialogue when learning about and discussing diversity, equality, and inclusion.*

Read through these provided articles to deepen your personal understanding, then log your reflections in your journal using the guiding questions as starting points.

## Norms  
*A standard or pattern, especially of social behavior, that is typical or expected of a group.*  

Norms will organically develop within a group unless a conscious effort is made to implement them. These 7 norms are a good starting place when engaging in conversations that put us outside of our comfort zones.

1) Pausing  
2) Paraphrasing  
3) Posing questions  
4) Putting ideas on and off the table  
5) Providing data  
6) Paying attention to self and others  
7) Presuming positive intentions  

Read through the more descriptive guide and journal about which norm you'd like to ensure you're doing when engaging in challenging discussions. Is one norm likely to be more difficult for you than another? Why? What benefits might you see from practicing the one that's hard?

## Structural Inequity  

*Structural inequality is defined as a condition where one category of people are attributed an unequal status in relation to other categories of people. This relationship is perpetuated and reinforced by a confluence of unequal relations in roles, functions, decisions, rights, and opportunities.*

## Equity vs Equality  

*Equity and equality are two strategies we can use in an effort to produce fairness. Equity is giving everyone what they need to be successful. Equality is treating everyone the same. Equality aims to promote fairness, but it can only work if everyone starts from the same place and needs the same help.*

## Implicit Bias  

*Also known as implicit social cognition, implicit bias refers to the attitudes or stereotypes that affect our understanding, actions, and decisions in an unconscious manner.  These biases, which encompass both favorable and unfavorable assessments, are activated involuntarily and without an individualâ€™s awareness or intentional control.  Residing deep in the subconscious, these biases are different from known biases that individuals may choose to conceal for the purposes of social and/or political correctness.  Rather, implicit biases are not accessible through introspection. The implicit associations we harbor in our subconscious cause us to have feelings and attitudes about other people based on characteristics such as race, ethnicity, age, and appearance.  These associations develop over the course of a lifetime beginning at a very early age through exposure to direct and indirect messages.  In addition to early life experiences, the media and news programming are often-cited origins of implicit associations.*  

A Few Key Characteristics of Implicit Biases: Implicit biases are pervasive.  Everyone possesses them, even people with avowed commitments to impartiality such as judges. Implicit and explicit biases are related but distinct mental constructs.  They are not mutually exclusive and may even reinforce each other. The implicit associations we hold do not necessarily align with our declared beliefs or even reflect stances we would explicitly endorse. The implicit associations we hold do not necessarily align with our declared beliefs or even reflect stances we would explicitly endorse. We generally tend to hold implicit biases that favor our own ingroup, though research has shown that we can still hold implicit biases against our ingroup. Implicit biases are malleable.  Our brains are incredibly complex, and the implicit associations that we have formed can be gradually unlearned through a variety of debiasing techniques.

## Intent vs Impact  



## Difficult Conversations  

*A difficult conversation is a situation in which at least two parties are engaged where (a) there are differing opinions, perceptions, and needs/wants, (b) feelings and emotions run strong, and (c) the consequences or stakes for us are significant.*
