## Difficult Conversations

*A difficult conversation is a situation in which at least two parties are engaged where (a) there are differing opinions, perceptions, and needs/wants, (b) feelings and emotions run strong, and (c) the consequences or stakes for us are significant.*

Evaluate the short story and graphic below:

#### Reflection Question(s):
* How does this cartoon address the topics we've learned about here?
* Using the photo as a template, sketch your own version of the story to make it more relevant to 2017 by switching the elephant for a more current topic and the blind men to other individuals or groups in society. Don't worry about your drawing skills here. It's the message we're hoping to see shine through!

Perspective has so much to do with the way conversations start and end. We all approach every situation wearing different filters, based on our past experiences. Much of what we've learned so far approaches what to do when we're faced with a challenging situation where we're expected to broach a difficult topic, but what are our best practices for when *we* are the one being approached? Part of being an effective communicator is being able to accept and learn from constructive feedback given by our superiors, our peers, and even our partners in life. Accepting feedback is tough, and changing our behaviors is even tougher. The following readings are listed to give you some new perspective and fresh ideas to consider.
