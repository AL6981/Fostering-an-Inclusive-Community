## Implicit Bias

*__Implicit bias__ refers to the attitudes or stereotypes that affect our understanding, actions, and decisions in an unconscious manner. These biases, which encompass both favorable and unfavorable assessments, are activated involuntarily and without an individualâ€™s awareness or intentional control. Residing deep in the subconscious, these biases are different from known biases that individuals may choose to conceal for the purposes of social and/or political correctness. Rather, implicit biases are not accessible through introspection. The implicit associations we harbor in our subconscious cause us to have feelings and attitudes about other people based on characteristics such as race, ethnicity, age, and appearance. These associations develop over the course of a lifetime beginning at a very early age through exposure to direct and indirect messages. In addition to early life experiences, the media and news programming are often-cited origins of implicit associations.*

A Few Key Characteristics of Implicit Biases: Implicit biases are pervasive.  Everyone possesses them, even people with avowed commitments to impartiality such as judges. Implicit and explicit biases are related but distinct mental constructs. They are not mutually exclusive and may even reinforce each other. The implicit associations we hold do not necessarily align with our declared beliefs or even reflect stances we would explicitly endorse. We generally tend to hold implicit biases that favor our own ingroup, though research has shown that we can still hold implicit biases against our ingroup. Implicit biases are malleable. Our brains are incredibly complex, and the implicit associations that we have formed can be gradually unlearned through a variety of debiasing techniques. ~[Kirwan Institute](http://kirwaninstitute.osu.edu/research/understanding-implicit-bias/)

* In your journal, sketch out a map of the groups you feel are your ingroups. Most people identify with multiple groups, which work to form a personal identity. You do not need to share this with anyone else! It's for your own reference, however, we will refer back to this again so be sure to write it down!

* Think about the 'single stories' you might hold for different groups that are, or are not, your ingroups. How might you have come about those stories? What influences the stories you carry? How can single stories influence the way we interact with others?
