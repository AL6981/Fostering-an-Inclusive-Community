## Intent vs Impact

*Your intent, the way in which you are communicating, doesnâ€™t necessarily send the messages and signals that help to achieve your desired goals, the impact.* [-Span ](https://smallbusiness.yahoo.com/advisor/intent-vs-impact-communicate-045122038.html)

### Microaggressions and Microinsults  
These are the everyday verbal, nonverbal, and environmental slights, snubs, or insults, whether intentional or unintentional, which communicate hostile, derogatory, or negative messages to target persons based solely upon their marginalized group membership. [-Psychology Today](https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/microaggressions-in-everyday-life/201011/microaggressions-more-just-race)

These are most often not _**intended**_ to be harmful, but they do impact others in a negative way, regardless. Below are some examples of things said to various minority groups. Have you heard any of these said before? Have you been the one saying them?  

* What _are_ you? You're so interesting looking.
* Wow Davis, you're so well-spoken.
* But, you're so feminine looking!
* You're way too hot to be a lesbian.
* Why are you so aggressive?
* No, where are you *really* from?
* I'm so OCD about my work area.
* Oh! You must be the cleaners.
* That's not bad for a girl.
* Wow, you handled those stairs so well!
* I could never handle being in a wheelchair. You're so brave.
* That's so retarded.
* That's so gay.
* You don't sound black.

#### Reflection Question(s):
* How do you currently address microaggressions on campus as an individual? As a team?
* Why may you give, or not give, a certain person or people from a specific group the benefit of the doubt after a challenging interaction?  

**It's most common for us to judge ourselves on our intent, and others on their impact.**  
* How might this cause problems when communicating?

* When have you found yourself in conflict due to a miscommunication regarding your intent vs the impact on another? How did you resolve the issue (if at all)? What could you have done differently?
