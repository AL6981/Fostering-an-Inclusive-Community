## Intent vs Impact

*Your intent, the way in which you are communicating, doesnâ€™t necessarily send the messages and signals that help to achieve your desired goals, the impact.* [-Span ](https://smallbusiness.yahoo.com/advisor/intent-vs-impact-communicate-045122038.html)

### Miscommunication
Miscommunication happens via verbal, nonverbal, and written messages, when a recipient of a message does not hear what the speaker intends to convey.

Envision this: A manager, Daniela, leads a meeting with 2 other team members, and the focus is a new email campaign. Daniela likes an idea shared by one team member. She responds, "Great plan David. I know this week is packed, but let's try and have that done by the end of the week anyway. I bet we'll see a boost in responses."

Daniela conveyed that she liked David's idea. David is the lead marketer, and Daniela intends for him to be the one to complete this task. David's week is overwhelming, and he hears her say 'let's try' which to him means anyone can do it, and it's not a hard deadline.

* What issues might arise from this miscommunication?

#### Reflection Question(s):  
![awarenss gap](http://www.the20project.com/uploads/1/5/6/7/15678964/6829539.jpg?311)  

**It's most common for us to judge ourselves on our intent, and others on their impact.**  
* How might this cause problems when communicating?  
* Presuming positive intentions is one of the norms we're adding into our repertoire. How can presuming positive intentions help us move forward a difficult conversation?
* Why may you give, or not give, a certain person or people from a specific group the benefit of the doubt after a challenging interaction?  
* When have you found yourself in conflict due to a miscommunication regarding your intent vs the impact on another? How did you resolve the issue (if at all)? Looking back, what could you have done differently?
