## Intent vs Impact

*Your intent, the way in which you are communicating, doesnâ€™t necessarily send the messages and signals that help to achieve your desired goals, the impact.* [-Span ](https://smallbusiness.yahoo.com/advisor/intent-vs-impact-communicate-045122038.html)

### Miscommunication
Miscommunication happens via verbal, nonverbal, and written messages, when a recipient of a message does not hear what the speaker intends to convey.

Envision this: A manager, Daniela, leads a meeting with 2 other team members, and the focus is a new email campaign. Daniela likes an idea shared by one team member. She responds, "Great plan David. I know this week is packed, but let's try and have that done by the end of the week anyway. I bet we'll see a boost in responses."

Daniela conveyed that she liked David's idea. David is the lead marketer, and Daniela intends for him to be the one to complete this task. David's week is overwhelming, and he hears her say 'let's try' which to him means anyone can do it, and it's not a hard deadline. What issues might arise from this miscommunication?

These are most often not _**intended**_ to be harmful, but they do impact others in a negative way, regardless. Below are some examples of things said to various minority groups. Have you heard any of these said before? Have you been the one saying them?  

* What _are_ you? You're so interesting looking.
* Wow Davis, you're so well-spoken.
* But, you're so feminine looking!
* You're way too hot to be a lesbian.
* Why are you so aggressive?
* No, where are you *really* from?
* I'm so OCD about my work area.
* Oh! You must be the cleaners.
* That's not bad for a girl.
* Wow, you handled those stairs so well!
* I could never handle being in a wheelchair. You're so brave.
* That's so retarded.
* That's so gay.
* You don't sound black.

#### Reflection Question(s):
* How do you currently address microaggressions on campus as an individual? As a team?
* Why may you give, or not give, a certain person or people from a specific group the benefit of the doubt after a challenging interaction?  

**It's most common for us to judge ourselves on our intent, and others on their impact.**  
* How might this cause problems when communicating?

* When have you found yourself in conflict due to a miscommunication regarding your intent vs the impact on another? How did you resolve the issue (if at all)? What could you have done differently?
