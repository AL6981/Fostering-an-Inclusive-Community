FIC Workshop #1

### Objectives:
1) Develop & implement a set of shared communication norms
2) Increase team understanding of structural inequity in tech & the difference between equity & equality  
3) Explore our individual implicit bias & understand how it affects our world view and the way we behave  
4) Practice & assess difficult conversation skills  

## Activator(3 min):  
*Journal*
Do you think this kind of work is valuable to Launch as a company? For the students? Support your response with at least three examples of why or why not. Sharing responses is optional.

## Warmup(10 min):
**Obj 2) Increase team understanding of structural inequity in tech & the difference  between equity & equality  
    3) Explore our individual implicit bias & understand how it affects our world view and the way we behave**  

*Gallery Walk(6 min):*  
~Posted around the room are the key terms and ideas we've learned about and will continue to discuss today. For the next 6 minutes you'll write a definition on each sheet, as you understand it. If you see something already written that resonates with you, star it in addition to writing your own.  

*Share Out(4 min):*  
~Who wants to share something that resonated with them? What did it say and why did that stand out?  

## Norms(20 min):
**Obj 1) Develop & implement a set of shared communication norms**  

In any group, norms & culture will develop. If those norms aren't made explicit, they'll develop organically, for better or worse. To create and sustain a culture of positivity, inclusion, and transparent communication, norms should be agreed upon and adhered to by the community at large. These norms must be explicitly modeled by leadership. In an educational setting, the educators and other student-facing staff must also be the group responsible for modeling norms and holding students accountable for the same.

*Turn & Talk(10 min):*  
~Turn to the person next to you and for 3 minutes, share your thoughts on the 7 suggested norms. Do you feel any aren't needed? Should something be added? Share for the full 3 minutes. The listener may not interrupt. Sit with silence when necessary.
~Switch positions for the next 3 minutes and repeat the exercise.
~Join with another pair of two.
~Share with the larger group a summary of what you think your partner's main ideas were.(1 min) The partner may clarify after the minute share out.
~Take turns sharing your partner's view with the group.
~Spend 3 minutes as a group deciding the three biggest take-aways to share with the whole team. Designate one speaker, and one person to put the info on a chart paper.

Whole Launch team reviews summary sheet. Does this guide us to a set list of agreed upon norms? Are there any items that leave us uncertain? Does more work need to be done or do we have consensus?
