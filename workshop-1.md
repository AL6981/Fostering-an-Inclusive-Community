# Fostering an Inclusive Community Workshop #1

### Objectives:
1) Develop & implement a set of shared communication norms  
2) Explore the ideas of intent vs impact  
3) Practice & assess difficult conversation skills   

## Activator (3 min):  
*Journal*  
Do you think this kind of work is valuable to you as a learner, as a communicator? How about for our students? Who else in your life might benefit from these skills? Support your response. Sharing responses is optional.

## Warmup (10 min):
**Objectives**  
1) Refresh our memories of the key terms we're exploring  
2) Gain a clearer understanding of our personal interpretation of the ideas  
3) Start to see how others perceive the same ideas  

*Gallery Walk(6 min):*  
~Posted around the room are the key terms and ideas we've learned about and will continue to discuss today. For the next 6 minutes you'll write a definition on each sheet, as you understand it. If you see something already written that resonates with you, star it in addition to writing your own.  
* Norms  
* Intent  
* Impact  
* Miscommunication
* Difficult conversations    
* Feedback  

*Share Out(4 min):*  
~Who wants to share something that resonated with them? What did it say and why did that stand out?  

## Norms (20 min):
**Objectives
1) Develop & implement a set of shared communication norms**  

<!-- In any group, norms & culture will develop. If those norms aren't made explicit, they'll develop organically, for better or worse. To create and sustain a culture of positivity, inclusion, and transparent communication, norms should be agreed upon and adhered to by the community at large. These norms must be explicitly modeled by leadership. In an educational setting, the educators and other student-facing staff must also be the group responsible for modeling norms and holding students accountable for the same.   -->

[The 7 Norms of Collaboration](https://docs.google.com/a/launchacademy.co/document/d/1w7sw8zIF1IJzBwF-Ld9EJ74wMLqrkC90aEyzzuSEiYk/edit?usp=sharing)  

__*Turn & Talk(10 min):*__  

~Turn to the person next to you and for 3 minutes & share your thoughts on the 7 suggested norms. Do you feel any aren't needed? Should something be added? Share for the full 3 minutes. The listener may not interrupt. Sit with silence when necessary.  
~Switch positions for the next 3 minutes and repeat the exercise.  
~Join with another pair of two.  
~Share with the larger group a summary of what you think your partner's main ideas were (1 min). The partner may clarify after the minute share out.  
~Take turns sharing your partner's view with the group.  
~Spend 3 minutes as a group deciding the three biggest take-aways to share with the whole team. Designate one speaker, and one person to put the info on a chart paper.  

__*Each group shares summary sheet with whole team.*__  

~Does this guide us to a set list of agreed upon norms?  
~Are there any items that leave us uncertain?  
~Does more work need to be done or do we have consensus?

### 15 Minute Movement Break!

## Intent vs Impact (45 min):
**Objectives**   
1) Explore our individual communication skills
2) Practice & assess difficult conversation skills  

#### It's most common for us to judge ourselves on our intent, and others on their impact.

<!-- There are many ways to offend, insult, and otherwise make someone feel badly. More often than not people do not intend to do so, but the way they phrase something, their use of body language, tone of voice, and even timing can lead to conflict. It's impossible to remove conflict from the workplace or learning environment, and I'm not sure we'd want to. Conflict, when managed well, can be the first step toward more growth and development. -->

Relying on our norms as a guide for *how* to communicate will allow us to enter a difficult conversation with more confidence.

Recall the reframing strategies shared in Chapter 11 of Difficult Conversations:  

> **Truth => Different stories  
> Accusations => Intentions & impact  
> Blame => Contribution  
> Judgements, characterizations => Feelings  
> What's wrong with you => What's going on for them**  

**In the Intent vs Impact Lesson** you were asked to reflect on a miscommunication between Daniela and David, and consider some issues that may have arisen. Who wants to share an issue they identified as potentially problematic?

**Group Discussion**  

~How could the use of norms have helped avoid this situation, or, resolve it without conflict/frustration?

![awareness gap](http://www.the20project.com/uploads/1/5/6/7/15678964/6829539.jpg?311)   

Here are a few sentence starters that lead a conversation toward a collaborative and positive outcome:
<!-- (Have group members scribe these on white board wall) -->

**~Sharing the impact**
<!-- * I don't know whether or not you intended this, but I felt...when...   -->
* After class today I left feeling discouraged because...
<!-- * This norm feels/felt neglected when...   -->

~Making requests  
* Can you help me understand how/why...  
<!-- * Let's work on how we might...  
* I wonder whether it's possible to...   -->

~Can the group share some others?  
<!-- * Instead of 'ya, but' use 'yes, and'   -->


### Snack Time! (5 min)  

## Difficult Conversations (60 min):
##### Time to Practice!  

Group should form seated circle, with 4 chairs in the center. Have Practice Protocol available.

**Demo Role Play**
Let's envision we are in a meeting with a few team members. During the discussion the same person interrupts you more than once. Finally, when you try to continue what you were saying, the person waves their hand as if to dismiss your statement, and finishes their thought. This takes the conversation in a new direction and you're left feeling devalued by the team member, and ignored by the whole team for so easily moving on, leaving your contribution unfinished.

Later in the day, the same team member says they've finished a story and would you be a second set of eyes? You're still feeling resentment from the morning meeting, and think this would be a good time to share that.

Three people share out what might *not* be effective in starting an open dialogue.
  Examples may be:  
  <!-- * "No way, you were a real jerk to me this morning. I can't believe you'd even ask me."
  * "Oh, *now* you want my thoughts? I don't think so."
  * "I'm busy sorry." -->

__*Why aren't these helpful?*__
<!-- (They don't open the lines of communication, person may shut down, get defensive.) -->

<!-- *While the intent of these statements may be to share frustration, the impact will be that the other person is also offended or may become defensive. Neither response would lead to a positive outcome.*   -->

__*What norms might be most helpful to us here? In what order?*__
<!-- (Many right answers here) -->

<!-- * The first norm that can support us here is *pausing*. Take a few seconds to gather your thoughts so you don't say the first thing that comes to mind.   
* *Presuming positive intentions* next will allow you to enter the conversation from a place of curiosity.
* *Pose a question* that will open the conversation. -->

<!-- Facilitator shares what might be a good starting sentence.   -->
  Examples may be:  
  * During the morning meeting, I felt like my ideas weren't being taken seriously. You spoke over me a few times, and I felt dismissed. I don't want to think your intent is to invalidate my ideas, but that's how it impacted me. Why would you dismiss me this morning but ask me for help now?
  * Hey, I'm happy you're asking for my help because it makes me feel like you value my work. I didn't feel that way during our morning meeting. You seemed so excited about your own ideas, that you spoke over mine and I wasn't able to share. I left feeling pretty devalued.

Next group enters fishbowl and runs through a scenario. Repeat.
