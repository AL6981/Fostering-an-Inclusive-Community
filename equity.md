## Structural Inequity & Equity vs Equality

*__Structural inequality__ is defined as a condition where one category of people are attributed an unequal status in relation to other categories of people. This relationship is perpetuated and reinforced by a confluence of unequal relations in roles, functions, decisions, rights, and opportunities. ~[wikipeda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structural_inequality)*

*__Equity__ and __equality__ are two strategies we can use in an effort to produce fairness. Equity is giving everyone what they need to be successful. Equality is treating everyone the same. Equality __aims__ to promote fairness, but it can only work if everyone starts from the same place and needs the same help. ~[Sun](http://everydayfeminism.com/2014/09/equality-is-not-enough/)*

After considering the three cartoons below, read the guiding questions and respond in your journal.

#### Reflection Question(s):
Cartoon 1 has been shared all around the education world, referencing the trend of assessing student capabilities by administering one standardized test. All students in this cartoon are being assessed equally, that is, given the same test.
* Does this seem fair? Why or why not?

Cartoon 2 is another image that has been shared far and wide to illustrate the differences between equality and equity. All three individuals wish to see over the fence. When given the same support, only two people are able to view the game. When given what they individually need in order to view the game, it's labeled equity.

Cartoon 3 takes cartoon 2 a step further, and removes the barrier that was present to begin with.

Consider all 3 cartoons.
* How might you apply the concepts of equity and equality to your instruction or to your supervision of a staff member?
* Can you think of any potential systemic barriers in place that prevent certain individuals/groups from applying to, enrolling in, paying for, or maintaining through the Launch program? What about for job applicants?
