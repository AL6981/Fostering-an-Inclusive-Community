## Norms
*A standard or pattern, especially of social behavior, that is typical or expected of a group.*

Norms will organically develop within a group unless a conscious effort is made to implement them. These 7 norms are a good starting place when engaging in conversations that put us outside of our comfort zones.

1) Pausing
2) Paraphrasing
3) Posing questions
4) Putting ideas on and off the table
5) Providing data
6) Paying attention to self and others
7) Presuming positive intentions

#### Reflection Question(s):
* Read through the more descriptive guide and write about which norm you'd like to ensure you're doing when engaging in challenging discussions. Is one norm likely to be more difficult for you than another? Why? What benefits might you see from practicing the one that's hard?
