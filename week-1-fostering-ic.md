# Fostering an Inclusive Community: Key Terms & Concepts  

*Having a shared vocabulary and common understanding of terms supports an active and productive dialogue when learning about and discussing diversity, equality, and inclusion.*

Read through the given content to deepen your personal understanding, then log your reflections & interpretations in your journal using the guiding questions as starting points.  

> “The relationship between the amount of writing for a course and students’ level of engagement — whether engagement is measured by time spent on the course, or the intellectual challenge it presents, or students’ level of interest in it — is stronger than the relationship between students’ engagement and any other course characteristic.”  ~ [Richard Light](https://www.questia.com/library/journal/1P3-592165951/writing-and-students-engagement)

## Norms  
*A standard or pattern, especially of social behavior, that is typical or expected of a group.*  

Norms will organically develop within a group unless a conscious effort is made to implement them. These 7 norms are a good starting place when engaging in conversations that put us outside of our comfort zones.

1) Pausing  
2) Paraphrasing  
3) Posing questions  
4) Putting ideas on and off the table  
5) Providing data  
6) Paying attention to self and others  
7) Presuming positive intentions

#### Reflection Question(s):
Read through the more descriptive guide and write about which norm you'd like to ensure you're doing when engaging in challenging discussions. Is one norm likely to be more difficult for you than another? Why? What benefits might you see from practicing the one that's hard?

## Structural Inequity & Equity vs Equality  

*__Structural inequality__ is defined as a condition where one category of people are attributed an unequal status in relation to other categories of people. This relationship is perpetuated and reinforced by a confluence of unequal relations in roles, functions, decisions, rights, and opportunities. ~[wikipeda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structural_inequality)*  

*__Equity__ and __equality__ are two strategies we can use in an effort to produce fairness. Equity is giving everyone what they need to be successful. Equality is treating everyone the same. Equality __aims__ to promote fairness, but it can only work if everyone starts from the same place and needs the same help. ~[Sun](http://everydayfeminism.com/2014/09/equality-is-not-enough/)*  

After considering the three cartoons below, read the guiding questions and respond in your journal.

Cartoon 3  
![structural inequity](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CiRZyUTUgAAfXzQ.jpg)

#### Reflection Question(s):  
Cartoon 1 has been shared all around the education world, referencing the trend of assessing student capabilities by administering one standardized test. All students in this cartoon are being assessed equally, that is, given the same test.  
* Does this seem fair? Why or why not?

Cartoon 2 is another image that has been shared far and wide to illustrate the differences between equality and equity. All three individuals wish to see over the fence. When given the same support, only two people are able to view the game. When given what they individually need in order to view the game, it's labeled equity.

Cartoon 3 takes cartoon 2 a step further, and removes the barrier that was present to begin with.

Consider all 3 cartoons.  
* How might you apply the concepts of equity and equality to your instruction or to your supervision of a staff member?  
* Can you think of any potential systemic barriers in place that prevent certain individuals/groups from applying to, enrolling in, paying for, or maintaining through the Launch program? What about for job applicants?

## Implicit Bias  

*__Implicit bias__ refers to the attitudes or stereotypes that affect our understanding, actions, and decisions in an unconscious manner. These biases, which encompass both favorable and unfavorable assessments, are activated involuntarily and without an individual’s awareness or intentional control. Residing deep in the subconscious, these biases are different from known biases that individuals may choose to conceal for the purposes of social and/or political correctness. Rather, implicit biases are not accessible through introspection. The implicit associations we harbor in our subconscious cause us to have feelings and attitudes about other people based on characteristics such as race, ethnicity, age, and appearance. These associations develop over the course of a lifetime beginning at a very early age through exposure to direct and indirect messages. In addition to early life experiences, the media and news programming are often-cited origins of implicit associations.*  

A Few Key Characteristics of Implicit Biases: Implicit biases are pervasive.  Everyone possesses them, even people with avowed commitments to impartiality such as judges. Implicit and explicit biases are related but distinct mental constructs. They are not mutually exclusive and may even reinforce each other. The implicit associations we hold do not necessarily align with our declared beliefs or even reflect stances we would explicitly endorse. We generally tend to hold implicit biases that favor our own ingroup, though research has shown that we can still hold implicit biases against our ingroup. Implicit biases are malleable. Our brains are incredibly complex, and the implicit associations that we have formed can be gradually unlearned through a variety of debiasing techniques. ~[Kirwan Institute](http://kirwaninstitute.osu.edu/research/understanding-implicit-bias/)

#### Reflection Question(s):
![web](https://sbt.blob.core.windows.net/site-images/site-pages/storyboard-creator/layouts/spider/spider_10.png)  

In your journal, sketch out a map of the groups you feel are your ingroups. Most people identify with multiple groups, which work to form a personal identity. You do not need to share this with anyone else! It's for your own reference, however, we will refer back to this again so be sure to write it down!

## Intent vs Impact  

*Your intent, the way in which you are communicating, doesn’t necessarily send the messages and signals that help to achieve your desired goals, the impact.* [-Span ](https://smallbusiness.yahoo.com/advisor/intent-vs-impact-communicate-045122038.html)

![intent vs impact](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CEu5At0UIAAJ2Ac.jpg)  

#### Reflection Question(s):
It's most common for us to judge ourselves on our intent, and others on their impact.
* How might this cause problems when communicating?
* Why may you give, or not give, a certain person the benefit of the doubt after a challenging interaction?  
* How can individuals work to be less defensive when experiencing conflict?

## Difficult Conversations  

*A difficult conversation is a situation in which at least two parties are engaged where (a) there are differing opinions, perceptions, and needs/wants, (b) feelings and emotions run strong, and (c) the consequences or stakes for us are significant.*  

Evaluate the short story and graphic below:  

![Blind Men & the Elephant](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/62/ce/e1/62cee1cca5a056b244781678c9d14202.jpg)  

#### Reflection Question(s):  
* How does this cartoon address the topics we've learned about here?
* Using the photo as a template, sketch your own version of the story to make it more relevant to 2017 by switching the elephant for a more current topic and the blind men to other individuals or groups in society. Don't worry about your drawing skills here. It's the message we're hoping to see shine through!
