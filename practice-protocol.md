# Practice Protocol

#### This activity can be done in multiple groups of 4 or as a fishbowl. In a fishbowl, the role-play group is in the center of a larger circle comprised of multiple observers.

##### Groups of 4
**Roles**
* player (2)
  * Player 1
  * Player 2
* facilitator
* observer

Roles should switch each round.
Facilitator reads the given scenario.  

1) Scenario is acted out (5 min)  

2) Facilitator watches the time and gives 1 minute warning.  

3) Facilitator and observer take notes of observations, things that went well, things that could be retried, clarifying questions.

4) When time's up, Player 1 shares with the group one thing they felt went well and one thing they felt could have been better. (1-2 min)

5) Player 2 shares how it felt to be on the receiving end of the feedback/difficult conversation. (1-2 min)

6) Facilitator and observer share their reflections. (2-4 min)

7) Re-enact scenario incorporating the feedback. (5 min)

### Group discussion:   
Was that conversation effective? Why or why not? What could have been done differently? Where might we use these skills while at work?
